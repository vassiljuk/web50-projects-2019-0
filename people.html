                                                    Yaanov or Midsummer Day marks the peak of the summer season.

Jaanov day traditions are rooted in pre-Christian fertility magic rituals preserved in Estonian root folk culture.</p>

				 <h2> Interesting Facts</h2>				
				    <div class="maininfo__intro">
<p>With the largest collection of folk songs in the world, 133,000 recorded tunes, Estonia has aptly been called the "singing nation". The lyrical tradition culminates every five years in the Estonian Song and Dance Celebration, a gathering of up to 200,000 performers and spectators.</p>

<p> Estonia is a digital society which was the first country to implement online voting in 2005, and virtually all tax returns are filed electronically. Citizens can sign legal documents remotely with their ID cards and anyone in the world can apply to be an e-resident. And yes, it's true - there is 4G coverage even in the middle of the woods.</p>

<p>As a child, you've surely dreamt of swinging so high that you go sailing over the top of the swing set. Estonians have turned this fantasy into a sport called 'Kiiking' (kiik is Estonian for swing). It involves strapping yourself upright onto an enormous swing and vigorously pumping your whole body with the goal of rotating 360 degrees. Your inner child will love it.</p>

<p>Of all the trees in Estonia, a towering oak in the village of Orissaare, Saaremaa is undoubtedly the most famous. It was voted European Tree of the Year in 2015 and stands right in the middle of a football field. Story has it that during Soviet times, two tractors tried to remove it but were no match for the mighty oak.</p>
