# Project 0

 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

    This  "project 0"  was created as a training project.
  The project contains four pages ( index.html  country.html city.html people.html). From each page it is possible to go to another page of the project.
  Folders (css, img, scss, js) are created for the location of files in them.
  The img folder contains pictures.
  The css folder contains style.css  bootstrap.min.css  style files
  The scss folder contains the style.scss  as style file
  The js folder contains the bootstrap.min.js script file, that we was copied from the Bootstrap website. Version v4.3.1

  The "header" uses:   list, row from Bootstrap, id-selector, class-selectors, nested selectors.
  The class = "img rounded-circle" makes the picture round.
  The adaptive property for "header" is made.
 
  I use the variable $backgroundColor for the whole project.

  The "My info" page contains a table. I use " @media screen and (max-width: 700px)" for adaptation on small screens (less than 700px).
 
  The oll project used the code for making a Sticky footer. It contains the details of the project owner.

  The "Country" page contains a carousel that is built on Bootstrap and a Bootstrap script.

  The "City" page contains photos and uses Bootstrap, adaptive property of pictures for small screens is made.

  I used different Basic Selectors in scss style:
  Type selector                 * | h2 {}
  Attribute selector            * [title] {}
  ID selector                   #header {}
  Class selector                .table {}
  Comma combinator              .carousel-control-prev-icon, .carousel-control-next-icon {}
  Child combinator              .menu > li {}

     and different css properties:
  text-align, font-size, font-weight, background-color, color, text-shadow, height, width, margin-top, margin-bottom, padding-top, flex .....
  and many others properties.
